# AgePrediction
Predicting Age with Multiple Linear Regression Analysis

## Summary
People in the US are living longer. The World Health Organization predicts the world's population over 60 will nearly double from 12% to 22% between 2015 and 2050. (World Health Organization 2024). This could be cause for some concern to major life insurance companies. Life insurance provides financial assistance to loved ones (beneficiaries) when the insured person dies. When life expectations and actual beneficiary survival rates exceed expectations, this results in greater-than-anticipated cash flow (Investopedia 2021). This is known as the longevity risk factor. This raises an important question for major life insurance companies about which health and lifestyle factors can predict a person's age. 

## Get Started
With Multiple Linear Regression analysis I will try to confirm the hypothysis that the following variable will statistically significantly affect Age (years).
## Lifestyle Variables
  Height (cm), 
  Weight (kg), 
  Cholesterol Level (mg/dL), 
  BMI, 
  Blood Glucose Level (mg/dL), 
  Stress Levels, 
  Bone Density (g/cmÂ²), 
  Sun Exposure, 
  Gender, 
  Physical Activity Level, 
  Smoking Status, 
  Alcohol Consumption, 
  Diet, 
  Chronic Diseases, 
  Vision Sharpness, 
  Hearing Ability (dB)

### Contributing 
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and contains both train and test datasets. Both train and test datasets have 3000 records and 25 variables. The variables include age and various health and lifestyle factors.
